# <h1 align="center"> MetaExchange </h1>

<p style="text-align: center;"> <b>MetaExchange</b> is a piece of code that always gives the user the best possible price if he is buying or selling a certain amount of BTC. Order matching logic takes into account balance constraints and cross exchange trades. </p>

## ðŸš€ Quickstart

> git clone https://github.com/filipzupancic/meta-exchange

- **Run MetaExchangeApi**

```
// Assuming you are in the root of the project and running from terminal.

> cd MetaExchangeApi/

// with Docker assuming you have docker Desktop installed

> docker-compose up --build

// without Docker

Add .env file and just copy what's in .env.example
Unzip order_books_data.7z in Data/ folder

> dotnet restore
> dotnet build
> dotnet run

Application swagger UI should be accessible on http://localhost:5057/swagger/index.html

Both GET and POST endpoints take two parameters:
Amount which is BTC: ex. 10
Type which is a string: Sell or Buy

You can also test the endpoint through Postman or with curl:
curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://localhost:5057/api/MetaExchange/quote?amount=10&type=Sell' \
  -H 'accept: text/plain'

curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:5057/api/MetaExchange/trade?amount=10&type=Buy' \
  -H 'accept: text/plain' \
  -d ''
```

- **Run MetaExchangeConsole**

```
// We only Dockerised MetaExchangeApi because it makes the most
// sense. MetaExchangeConsole was used mainly for debugging.

Unzip order_books_data.7z in MetaExchangeApi/Data/ folder
> cd MetaExchangeConsole/
> dotnet restore
> dotnet build
> dotnet run

```

- **Run MetaExchangeTest**

```
// There are 4 unit tests inside OrderBookMatchingTest.cs.

> cd MetaExchangeTest/
> dotnet restore
> dotnet build
> dotnet test
```

## ðŸ“¦ Structure

**MetaExchangeApi**: Web service (Kestrel, .NET Core API) which follows Modelâ€“viewâ€“controller (MVC) design pattern with added support for Docker so It can be run in a docker container.

- **Controllers/MetaExchangeController** class handles the logic for quoting the best prices for trades, utilizing MetaExchangeService service to load order books and match trades efficiently. It employs caching to store order books, reducing the need for repeated loading from the file system, and features a GET and POST endpoints that provide trade pricing information based on user-specified criteria.

- **Services/MetaExchangeService** class handles order book loading, order sorting and order matching. Order matching takes into account balance constraints and cross exchange trades.

- **Services/OrderBookHostedService** class handles order book loading and caching on Startup so we don't need to load it every time.

- **Models/OrderBookModel** is where classes that represent OrderBook object are defined.

- **Models/MetaExchangeModel** is where classes that represent BestPathResponse object are defined.

- **Data/** contains order_books_data.7z. It is compressed due to GitHub size limits.

**MetaExchangeConsole**: This is a simple console project that holds similar logic to the MetaExchangeApi and is useful for debugging as it isolates core logic from web api features.

**MetaExchangeTest**: Simple unit tests for verification of the order matching logic.
